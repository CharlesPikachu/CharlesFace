# Face detection and recognition.
```sh
The implement of face detection is based on [*YOLO*](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/).
The implement of face recognition/classification is based on [*Facenet*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832).
```

# Warning
```sh
This is a bad project now(I'm too busy to update that project, but the project must be existing for some reasons).
Maybe there would be some bugs in FaceDetect. 
If you get any bugs, you could open a issue to get my help.
```
